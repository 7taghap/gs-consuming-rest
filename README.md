Getting Started: Consuming REST Services with Spring
=========================================

This Getting Started guide will walk you through the process of consuming a REST service using Spring's `RestTemplate`.

To help you get started, we've provided an initial project structure for you in GitHub:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/springframework-meta/gs-consuming-rest-core.git
```

Before we can write the REST endpoint itself, there's some initial project setup that's required. Or, you can skip straight to the [fun part]().

Selecting Dependencies
----------------------
The sample in this Getting Started Guide will leverage Spring and the Jackson JSON processor. Therefore, you'll need to declare the following library dependencies in your build:

  - org.springframework:spring-web:3.2.2.RELEASE
  - org.codehaus.jackson:jackson-mapper-asl:1.9.9

Click here for details on how to map these dependencies to your specific build tool.

Invoking REST services with the RestTemplate
----------------------------
Spring provides a convenient template class called the `RestTemplate`. The `RestTemplate` makes interacting with most RESTful services a one-liner incantation. In the example below, we establish a few variables and then make a request of the Twitter search service. The result comes back - in this case - as a String that we can print to the console. 


```java
package hello;

import org.codehaus.jackson.JsonNode;
import org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) throws Throwable {

        String searchUrl = "http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q={query}";
        String searchQueryPathVariableValue = "@gopivotal";

        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

        String bodyOfResponse = restTemplate.getForObject(searchUrl, String.class, searchQueryPathVariableValue);
        // work with the response body
    }
}
```

This is not as useful as you'd think, however, because the Twitter search service returns JSON-structured data. It's easy enough to get meaningful payloads from this, however. The `RestTemplate` supports configuration of `HttpMessageConverter` objects that can convert request and response payloads as appropriate. If the Jackson JSON processing library is on the classpath, then it can be used to convert the requested data into your custom domain objects or - at a minimum - the Jackson `JsonNode` base type. Add the following incantations at the bottom of the `main` method.

>__TODO__: briefly talk about what message converters do and list the ones that come out of the box with Spring}

```java
        JsonNode rootNode = restTemplate.getForObject(searchUrl, JsonNode.class, searchQueryPathVariableValue);
```

Now you can iterate over the results in terms of nodes in the JSON structure. If you want to inspect the HTTP headers of the response, or the status code, use the `*forEntity` variant methods of the `RestTemplate` that return the payload, as before, along with an envelope (`ResponseEntity`) that has details about headers, status code, etc. Add this to the bottom of your `main` method:

```java
        ResponseEntity<JsonNode> response = restTemplate.getForEntity(
                    searchUrl, JsonNode.class, searchQueryPathVariableValue);
        HttpHeaders httpHeaders = response.getHeaders();
```

Thus far, we've only used the HTTP verb `GET` to make requests against the 

Building and Running the Client
--------------------------------------
To invoke the code and see the results of the search, simply run it from the command line, like this:

```sh
$ gradle run
```
	
This will cause the application to be compiled and then run the main method.
